# Track Life
---

Full Stack Capstone Project

## Introduction

I use a bullet journal to keep track of my activities. This inspired me to create a antithesis of current habit/routine tracker mobile and web apps. I preferred paper & pencil because it was simple. I don't need to set goals and feel that I'm always "underperforming". I don't need to be reminded of my progress via emails, text messages or alerts. I do like seeing the visual progress. Use the minimalist info as you will. Here is my take on tracking. Please enjoy!
